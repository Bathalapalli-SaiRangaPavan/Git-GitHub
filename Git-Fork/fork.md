# Git Fork 
- A fork is a copy of a repository that sits in your account rather than the account from which you forked the data from. Once you have forked a repo, you own your forked copy. This means that you can edit the contents of your forked repository without impacting the parent repository. 
- The fork will also "know" from which repository it has been forked.
- Your fork acts as a bridge between the original repository & your personal copy where you can contribute back to the original project using pull requests. 
- The workflow usually includes forking a repository owned by someone into your github account, clone the fork of yoor repository to your local machine, make edits, commit & push those edits back to your fork on github and create a PR to original source.
- Forking a project is as easy as clicking the fork button in the header of repository. Once the process is complete, you will be taken right to your the forked copy of the project so you can start collabarating.
- When you do git clone you cannot contribute. 
- When you do git fork you can contribute raising PR. 

### Practical - I want to contribute to the project. This Project becomes upstream repository.
- Step 1 - Fork repository from others.
- Step 2 - Git clone the forked repsoitory 
- Step 3 - Edit the file and move to remote repository (your own forked repository)
But i want to do in the upstream repository.
- Step 4 - Click (Pull Request) -> (New Pull Request) -> Merge (from ur branch to other branch) -> (Create Pull Request) 
- Step 5 - Maintainer of upstream project will review it and gives approval
- Step 6 - Confirm Merge
