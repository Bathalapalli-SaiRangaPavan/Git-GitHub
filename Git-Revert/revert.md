# Git Revert 

-  Revert some existing commits
-  git revert is used to record some new commits to reverse the effect of some earlier commits

### Scenario 
You've committed twice to master and itâ€™s bad. You've pushed and other people have your bad changes.You want to undo it. You just want to put it all back how it was.

#### Practical 

Step 1 - Cretae a file named testing.txt and add content and save it.
```
hello this is to test
```
Step 2 - When u check git status it is untracked move it to staging area, local repository and push it to remote repository
```
git status
```
```
git add .
```
```
git commit -m "testingt"
```
```
git push origin master
```
When u go to remote repository, you can see testing.txt. Now i want to revert back from the remote repository. Execute below commands in local repository.
```
git log 
```
Take the latest commit id

```
git revert <commit id>
```
it opens (i -> reverted... )at start u give the content let it be

```
git push origin master
```
you can see its deleted in the remote repository.
